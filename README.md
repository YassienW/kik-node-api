### Getting Started

You can use the API by creating an instance of `KikClient`, you'll use it to listen
to events and send requests to kik

```javascript
const KikClient = require("kik-node-api");

Kik = new KikClient({
   promptCaptchas: true,
   device: {
       
   },
   logger: {
      file: ["warning", "error", "info", "raw"],
      console: ["warning", "error", "info", "raw"]
   }
});

Kik.authenticate(username, password)
```

`promptCaptchas`: prompt in the console to solve captchas. If not you must handle it yourself using the [event](#received-captcha)

`logger`: configuration for the logger, the array contains the type of logs

The user object:

```
user: { 
    jid: "kikteam@talk.kik.com", 
    username: "kikteam",
    displayName: "Kik Team",
    pic: "http://profilepics.cf.kik.com/luN9IXX3a4sks-RzyiC7xlK-HdE"
}
```
The group object
```
group: {
    jid: "1100221067977_g@groups.kik.com",
    code: "#kikbotapi",
    name: "Kik Bot API Unofficial",
    users: [
        {jid: "jid1", isOwner: true, isAdmin: true},
        {jid: "jid2", isAdmin: true},
        {jid: "jid3"}
    ]
}
```
private groups have a code of null

### Events
#### The Basics

`KikClient` uses Node's [Event Emitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html) class
to handle events, all events are attached in the following way:

```javascript
Kik.on(eventname, (param1, param2) => {
    //do stuff with params here
})
```

Below are the details of all events emitted by the `KikClient` class

##### Connected

```javascript
Kik.on("connected", () => {
    console.log("Connected")
})
```

```javascript
Kik.on("authenticated", (isAnonymous) => {
    console.log("Authenticated")
})
```
`isAnonymous`: if `true` the authentication was done anonymously
(no username/password)

```javascript
Kik.on("receivedroster", (groups, friends) => {
    console.log(groups);
